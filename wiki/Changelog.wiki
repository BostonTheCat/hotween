== v0.8.017 ==
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Removed leftover Debug.Log message from *PlugVector3Path*.

== v0.8.016 ==
==== New Features ====
  * Added *PlugRect* plugin (thanks to Romain Giraud), which is now used by default with Rect properties.
  * Added lookAhead option in *PlugVector3Path* *OrientToPath* parameter.

== v0.8.015 ==
==== New Features ====
  * Added *HOTween.From*.
  * Now *PlugString* checks for null values and replaces them with "".

== v0.8.011 ==
==== New Features ====
More parameters can now be changed while playing, including:
  * *IHOTweenComponent*[_Tweener or Sequence_].timeScale, .loops, .loopType.
  * *Tweener*.easeType.

== v0.8.007 ==
==== Changes ====
  * Sequences are now automatically paused at startup (you will need to call mySequence.Play() to start them).
  * *ConstantSpeed* parameter removed from *PlugVector3Path*: now paths use constant speed by default.
==== Optimizations ====
  * Optimized drawing of path gizmos.

== v0.8.006 ==
==== New Features ====
  * Added *ConstantSpeed* parameter to *PlugVector3Path*, which animates with constant speed along the path.
  * Added *SpeedBased* parameter to *TweenParms*, to allow speed-based instead than time-based tweens (when using this parameter, duration is interpreted as speedxseconds).
  * String properties can now be animated using defaults (without the need to add PlugString).

== v0.8.005 ==
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Fixed iOS compatibility.

== v0.8.004 ==
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Corrected bug where default loopType wasn't changed when changing HOTween.defLoopType value.

== v0.8.002 ==
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Fixed PlugVector3Path OrientToPath orienting on incorrect axis.
  * Fixed PlugVector3Path OrientToPath flipping orientation on certain conditions issue.

== v0.8.001 ==
First Google Code release
==== Changes ====
  * HOTween main namespace is now Holoville.HOTween instead than Holoville.Tweening.

== v0.7.301 ==
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Fixed delay bug (if delay was longer than duration, the tween would not start).

== v0.7.300 ==
==== Changes ====
  * *Warning!* EaseType enum values now start with an uppercase letter (due to the fact that EaseType is now a true enum, and relies on another class to store the ease functions). This means for example EaseType.EaseOutQuad instead than EaseType.easeOutQuad.
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Changing HOTween's timeScale doesn't affect eventual tween delays anymore.

== v0.7.202 ==
First release.
