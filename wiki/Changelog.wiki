First Google Code release
==== Changes ====
  * HOTween main namespace is now Holoville.HOTween instead than Holoville.Tweening.

==== Bugfixes ====
  * Fixed delay bug (if delay was longer than duration, the tween would not start).

== v0.7.300 ==
==== Changes ====
  * *Warning!* EaseType enum values now start with an uppercase letter (due to the fact that EaseType is now a true enum, and relies on another class to store the ease functions). This means for example EaseType.EaseOutQuad instead than EaseType.easeOutQuad.
==== Bugfixes ====
  * Changing HOTween's timeScale doesn't affect eventual tween delays anymore.
